Changes in Version 1.0-3 (2014-06-27)
-------------------------------------------------------

Features:
x included model fit statistics (Q3, SRMR, MADRESIDCOV): 'tam.modelfit'
x included 'tam.mml.3pl' for 3PL estimation, general design
  matrices for item slopes and options for discrete 
  latent variables (estimation of latent class models,
  located latent class model, skew distributions,
  mixed IRT models, cognitive diagnosis models, ...
  is now possible)
x extended tam.pv for objects of class 'tam.mml.3pl'
x speeded data preparation of faceted models a bit
x tam.se now computes standard errors for estimated slope parameters, B 
  (for irtmodel in c("2PL", "GPCM", "2PL.groups")); highly experimental 
  for irtmodel="GPCM.design"). 
x plot.tam now prints a message about the location of the exported graphics.
x plot.tam has a new argument 'items' for selecting the items to
  be displayed. RD-file adjusted.
x plot.tam has new arguments 'export.type="png"' and "export.args=list()" for 
  selecting the file type for the graphics export. The supported file types 
  are those supported by ?dev.new. The argument 'export.args=list()' is 
  for specifying a list of arguments for the export device method.
x tam.threshold has a new argument prob.lvl to set the probability level of 
  the thresholds.

Bug fixes:
x fixed a bug in pid output in object 'person' for multidimensional models
  (thanks to Sebastian Weirich)
x fixed a bug in variance estimation for multiple group 2PL models
x included 'designMatrices.mfr2' for a provisional bug fix
  for multifaceted models with differing number of categories
  per item (see Example 16 in tam.mml; thanks to Christoph Duchhardt)
x fixed a bug in 'tam.mml.mfr' for differing number of categories
  per item -> now a xsi vector with parameter fixings to values 
  of 99 is used 
x plot.tam is debugged regarding the case of missing WLEs for some 
  person (thanks to Florian Buchwald). 
x plot.tam now doesn't throw a warning when the 'Plots' directory 
  already exists.
x fixed a bug in plot.tam for cross-platform accordance (thanks to Uli Keller).
x fixed a bug in tam.fit with missing item scores
x fixed a bug in tam.jml so that ../Tutorials/6Population.htm now runs without 
  error.

Notes:
x tam.fit is experimental for objects obtained from tam.mml.mfr.
x changed convergence behavior in tam.wle (thanks to Peter Harych)
x changed item sorting in output object 'item'
x tam.mml(/.2pl/.mfr) methods now return Q, tam.mml.2pl additionaly returns
  B.fixed, basispar, E, and est.slopegroups objects. RD-file adjusted.
x tam.jml(/.jml2) do not return fit statistics anymore. Item and person fit can
  be obtained by a call to tam.fit (/.jml.fit).
x in case of multidimensional analyses, we recommend an update of 
  the R-package mvtnorm to version 0.9-99992 or higher.
x extended example 13 in tam.mml.Rd to the case of polytomous longitudinal 
  data (requested by and thanks to Florian Buchwald)
x extended example 6 in tam.mml.Rd to the specification of sum constraints 
  on the item parameters in a PCM model for differing number of categories.
x Some minor changes in RD-files (eg., irtmodel for argument 'E' in 
  tam.mml.2pl is "GPCM.design", theta value in tam.jml is "MLE in final step").

x tam.mml.mfr now accepts polytomous data with more than 
  ten categories per item
