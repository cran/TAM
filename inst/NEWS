-------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Versions 0.91/0.99 (2013-11-02)
-------------------------------------------------------

  parameters in 'tam.mml' (request by Kelvin Gregory)
x included argument 'adj' in tam.jml/tam.jml2 for modifying 
  the adjustment in case of perfect scores (thanks to Courtney Castle)

-------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------

x removed blanks in item category labels in tam.ctt2 and 
  tam.ctt3
x allowed non-integer group labels
x fixed a bug in data preparation for facet models 
  which appeared since a change in TAM 0.7 
  (thanks to Jonathan Williams)

-------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Versions 0.8 (2013-10-02)
-------------------------------------------------------

  number categories per item

  reached
x included deviance plot 'plotDevianceTAM' 
  (thanks to Sebastian Weirich)
x included tam.ctt3

-------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Versions 0.7 (2013-09-15)
-------------------------------------------------------

x include crossprod in some functions
x fixed a bug for using latent regression models in
  facet model function 'tam.mml.mfr'
  (thanks to Jonathan Williams)
x included another facet example (Example 14)
x fixed a bug in tam.mml.mfr if all facets possess
  the same number of levels
x fixed a bug in multidimensional generalized partial
  credit model estimation and speeded 2PL estimation a bit
x included bifactor model and exploratory factor analysis
  -> function 'tam.fa' with arguments irtmodel='efa','bifactor'
x now printing progress in tam.ctt2 correctly
x fixed a bug in data processing in tam.mml.mfr for factor
  or string input of facets
x included more examples in tam.fit, anova.tam.mml, tam.pv,
  tam.jml, tam.se, tam.wle 
x avoided inversion of singular matrices in multidimensional
  WLE estimation tam.wle (thanks to Iasonas Lamprianou)
x removed bugs for item response datasets with only one item
  in tam.mml and tam.mml.2pl
x fixed a bug in tam.ctt2: multiple groups were not displayed 
x included an option for deleting redundant generalized items
  which sometimes improves computation speed
x cleaned the TAM manual (thanks to Michaela Mayr)
x changed output structure of tam.fa and included rotation
  examples in tam.fa.Rd
x included additional convergence stabilizing approach which
  can be activated using the argument 'fac.oldxsi' in control
  -> See Example 15 for such a non-converging model where
     changing algorithmic defaults seems necessary
   (problem addressed thanks to Sebastian Weirich) 
x substituted internal 'theta.sq' function by Rcpp based
  function 'theta.sq2'
x started with including examples similar to the ones in
  the ConQuest 2.0 manual (see data.cqc.Rd)

-------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Versions 0.6 (2013-08-28)
-------------------------------------------------------

x fixed a bug when in latent regression when providing a formula
  in argument 'formulaY'
x fixed a bug in output of tam.se (thanks to Sebastian Weirich)
x included a faster alternative to tam.ctt -> tam.ctt2 is based
  on a Rcpp function
x allowed freeing beta constraints by the user by including
  the possible argument beta.fixed=FALSE
x removed a bug in data processing for faceted designs
  (thanks to Michaela Mayr)
x fixed a bug with varying string lengths of facet levels
x fixed a bug in tam.ctt2 for numeric input matrices
x fixed incorrect handling of constraints in regression coefficients
  which was just included in a recent 0.6 version
x fixed an output bug in tam.wle in multidimensional models
  (thanks to Jan Henning-Kahmann)
x accelerated estimation of multdimensional models (different
  approach of calculating the prior distribution)
x fixed a bug when submitting xsi.inits and beta.inits to tam
x fixed a bug in facet models when a facet contains only one
  element (twice thanks to Michaela Mayr)
x included irtmodel='PCM2' (partial credit model with ConQuest
  parametrization) and irtmodel='RSM' (rating scale model)
x added a longitudinal data example in 'tam.mml' manual
