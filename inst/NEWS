  based on individual posterior (output of 'IRT.posterior')

Bug fixes:
* fixed a bug for input of a B loading matrix with no item labels
* fixed a bug in 'plot.tam' with missing data in item responses
  (bug fix provided by Michal Modzelewski)
* corrected an included bug in recent TAM versions in AIC
  calculation (thanks to Simon Grund)
* fixed a bug in variance fixing in 'tam.fa' which occured in a 
  recent TAM version due to changes in defaults in 'tam.mml.2pl'

  fixing of xsi parameter groups. A warning is now given if the
  combination of person and facet identifiers is not unique.     
* allowed also explicit use of facets without effects in 'tam.mml.mfr'
  on 'formulaA', e.g. 'item*step + 0*rater' sets all rater effects
  to zero
* included wranings in 'tam.wle' if the WLE is (possibly) not estimable
  (suggested by Rainer Alexandrowicz)

  (thanks to Matthias Trendtel)
* extended tam.modelfit to handle multi matrix design appropriately
* changed defaults in 'est.variance' if 'variance.fixed' is provided
  in 'tam.mml.2pl'. The previous default led to bugs in the
