-------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Version 1.1   (2014-10-19)
-------------------------------------------------------

Features:
* added user defined variance function in tam.mml and
  tam.mml.2pl
* added user defined constraints on slope parameters
  in 'tam.mml.3pl'

Bug fixes:
* fixed a bug in deviance computation in 'tam.mml.3pl' when
  stochastic nodes are used
* (hopefully) fixed computational problems in multidimensional models
  with nearly singular covariance matrix 
  (thanks to a discussion with Johannes Hartig)  

Notes:
* added a plot function 'plot.ctt' accompanying the classical test 
  theory based statistic
* fixed a bug in creation of design matrices in faceted models with
  differing categories per item (thanks to Michal Modzelewski). 
  Note that the treatment of faceted models is still not compatible
  with other software (like ConQuest). A substantial bug fix
  is planned in future TAM relaeses. 

Datasets included or modified:
* data.ctest1 (thanks to HGP)

Examples included or modified:
* tam.fit (4), tam.mml (17), tam.ctt (1)


-------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Version 1.0-3.18 (2014-09-08)

  for multidimensional models (reported by Janine Buchholz and
  Jörg-Henrik Heine)

Notes:
x included SRMSR fit statistic in tam.modelfit
x included argument "Nsimul" in "tam.fit" which improves
  calculation of fit statistics

-------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Version 1.0-3 (2014-06-27)
-------------------------------------------------------

Features:
x included model fit statistics (Q3, SRMR, MADRESIDCOV): 'tam.modelfit'
x included 'tam.mml.3pl' for 3PL estimation, general design
  matrices for item slopes and options for discrete 
  latent variables (estimation of latent class models,
  located latent class model, skew distributions,
  mixed IRT models, cognitive diagnosis models, ...
  is now possible)
x extended tam.pv for objects of class 'tam.mml.3pl'
x speeded data preparation of faceted models a bit
x tam.se now computes standard errors for estimated slope parameters, B 
  (for irtmodel in c("2PL", "GPCM", "2PL.groups")); highly experimental 
  for irtmodel="GPCM.design"). 
x plot.tam now prints a message about the location of the exported graphics.
x plot.tam has a new argument 'items' for selecting the items to
  be displayed. RD-file adjusted.
x plot.tam has new arguments 'export.type="png"' and "export.args=list()" for 
  selecting the file type for the graphics export. The supported file types 
  are those supported by ?dev.new. The argument 'export.args=list()' is 
  for specifying a list of arguments for the export device method.
x tam.threshold has a new argument prob.lvl to set the probability level of 
  the thresholds.

Bug fixes:
x fixed a bug in pid output in object 'person' for multidimensional models
  (thanks to Sebastian Weirich)
x fixed a bug in variance estimation for multiple group 2PL models
x included 'designMatrices.mfr2' for a provisional bug fix
  for multifaceted models with differing number of categories
  per item (see Example 16 in tam.mml; thanks to Christoph Duchhardt)

  per item -> now a xsi vector with parameter fixings to values 
  of 99 is used

  person (thanks to Florian Buchwald). 
x plot.tam now doesn't throw a warning when the 'Plots' directory 
  already exists.
x fixed a bug in plot.tam for cross-platform accordance (thanks to Uli Keller).
x fixed a bug in tam.fit with missing item scores
x fixed a bug in tam.jml so that ../Tutorials/6Population.htm now runs without 
  error.

  the R-package mvtnorm to version 0.9-99992 or higher.
x extended example 13 in tam.mml.Rd to the case of polytomous longitudinal 
  data (requested by and thanks to Florian Buchwald)
